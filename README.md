# Adding all the newest features and changes to Revamped, just to keep the original preserved for now.
# Will probably swap Master with this and put the original demo in a separate branch.

# Small demo project a classmate and I worked on for a presentation. Done in Rust as this was the language we chose to demonstrate.
# Slowly working on creating a text-based adventure game with turn based style combat.
